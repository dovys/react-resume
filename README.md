# react-resume
An attempt of rewriting my static html resume into a react project.
**Motivation**
* After filling a static html resume content often it's annoying to do any restructurings as repetetive elements usually are cp'd.
* Organising the data to a better format. I chose [jsonresume.org](https://jsonresume.org/schema/) as it seemed more well suited for the task than for ex. JSON-LD.
